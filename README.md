## Improvise Jazz Solo with LSTM Network

This repository showcases my implementation of an LSTM network for generating jazz music improvisations. By applying deep learning techniques, I have successfully generated unique jazz music compositions.

Highlights:

LSTM Network: Utilized LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies and generate music sequences. <br>
Jazz Music Generation: Trained the LSTM network on a jazz music dataset, enabling the generation of original jazz music compositions. <br>
Flexible Functional API: Utilized Keras to build complex deep learning models for music generation.<br>
Explore the code and outputs to witness the LSTM network in action, creating captivating jazz music solos through deep learning techniques.

Note: The code and outputs are specific to the "Improvise Jazz Solo with LSTM Network" project and may require adaptations for different music genres or music generation tasks.
